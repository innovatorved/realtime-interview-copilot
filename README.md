## Prerequisites

### Audio Loopback Setup (Required for capturing system audio)

To capture audio from online interviews (Zoom, Meet, Teams, etc.), you need to route your system audio output to the microphone input using audio loopback software.

#### macOS - BlackHole

1. **Install BlackHole**:
   ```bash
   brew install blackhole-2ch
   ```
   Or download from: https://existential.audio/blackhole/

2. **Create Multi-Output Device**:
   - Open **Audio MIDI Setup** (Applications > Utilities > Audio MIDI Setup)
   - Click the **+** button at the bottom left and select **Create Multi-Output Device**
   - Check both your **speakers/headphones** and **BlackHole 2ch**
   - This allows you to hear audio while routing it to BlackHole

3. **Create Aggregate Device** (for microphone input):
   - In Audio MIDI Setup, click **+** and select **Create Aggregate Device**
   - Check both **BlackHole 2ch** and your **microphone**
   - This combines system audio with your mic input

4. **Configure System Audio**:
   - Go to **System Settings > Sound**
   - Set **Output** to the Multi-Output Device you created
   - In the Realtime Interview Copilot app, select the Aggregate Device as your input

#### Windows - VB-Audio Virtual Cable

1. **Install VB-Audio Virtual Cable**:
   - Download from: https://vb-audio.com/Cable/
   - Run the installer as Administrator
   - Restart your computer after installation

2. **Configure Playback Device**:
   - Right-click the speaker icon in the system tray
   - Select **Sounds** > **Playback** tab
   - Set **CABLE Input** as the default playback device
   - OR use **Voicemeeter** for more advanced routing (recommended)

3. **Configure Recording Device**:
   - In the **Recording** tab
   - Right-click **CABLE Output** and select **Properties**
   - Go to **Listen** tab
   - Check **Listen to this device**
   - Select your speakers/headphones from the dropdown (to hear audio)
   - Click **Apply**

4. **Alternative: Voicemeeter Banana** (Recommended):
   - Download from: https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm
   - Install and configure:
     - Set your browser/app audio output to Voicemeeter Input
     - Route Voicemeeter to your speakers (Hardware Out A1)
     - In Realtime Interview Copilot, select **Voicemeeter Output** as input
   - Voicemeeter provides better control and mixing capabilities

#### Linux - PulseAudio/PipeWire

1. **Using PulseAudio**:
   ```bash
   # Create a null sink
   pactl load-module module-null-sink sink_name=virtual_speaker
   
   # Create a loopback from null sink to your microphone
   pactl load-module module-loopback source=virtual_speaker.monitor
   
   # Redirect application audio to the null sink
   # Set virtual_speaker as output in your interview application
   ```

2. **Using PipeWire** (Modern Linux):
   - Install `helvum` or `qpwgraph` for graphical audio routing
   - Connect your application output to both speakers and recording input

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/innovatorved/realtime-interview-copilot.git
cd realtime-interview-copilot
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Run the Application

**Development Mode**:
```bash
pnpm electron:dev
```

**Debug Mode** (with developer tools):
```bash
pnpm electron:debug
```

**Build for Production**:
```bash
pnpm electron:build
```

The built application will be in the `dist` directory:
- **macOS**: `.dmg` and `.zip` files
- **Windows**: `.exe` installer and portable version
- **Linux**: `.AppImage` and `.deb` packages

## Authentication & Database Setup

This project uses **Better Auth** for authentication and **Cloudflare D1** as the database.

### 1. Database Setup (Cloudflare D1)

The application requires a Cloudflare D1 database to store user and session data.

1.  **Create a new D1 database**:
    ```bash
    npx wrangler d1 create realtime-interview-copilot-db
    ```

2.  **Update Configuration**:
    Copy the `database_id` from the output of the previous command and update `realtime-worker-api/wrangler.toml`:
    ```toml
    [[d1_databases]]
    binding = "DB"
    database_name = "realtime-interview-copilot-db"
    database_id = "YOUR_DATABASE_ID_HERE" # <--- Update this
    migrations_dir = "drizzle"
    ```

3.  **Generate Migrations**:
    Navigate to the worker directory and generate the database schema migrations:
    ```bash
    cd realtime-worker-api
    pnpm install
    npx drizzle-kit generate
    ```

4.  **Apply Migrations**:
    Apply the migrations to your remote Cloudflare D1 database:
    ```bash
    npx wrangler d1 migrations apply realtime-interview-copilot-db --remote
    ```
    *(For local development, you can use `npx wrangler d1 migrations apply realtime-interview-copilot-db --local`)*

### 2. Authentication Setup

The authentication is handled by the `realtime-worker-api`. Ensure you have configured the necessary environment variables if you are using social providers (e.g., Google, GitHub).

## Privacy & Security

### Screen Share Protection
The application window is **protected from screen sharing** - it will not be visible when you share your screen during video interviews. This ensures your AI assistance remains private and confidential during the interview process.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No Audio Detected
- **Check audio loopback setup** - Ensure BlackHole/VB-Cable is properly configured
- **Verify device selection** - Select the correct aggregate/loopback device in the app
- **Test system audio** - Play a sound to confirm audio routing works

#### App Won't Start
- **Check Node.js version** - Ensure you're using Node.js 20 or higher
- **Clear cache** - Run `pnpm clean` and rebuild
- **Reinstall dependencies** - Delete `node_modules` and run `pnpm install`

### Development Tips

**Clean build artifacts**:
```bash
pnpm clean
```

**View detailed logs** (development):
```bash
pnpm electron:debug
```
